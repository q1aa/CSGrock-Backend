# CSGrok (.NET C#) // Backend

Check out the [project website here.](https://tunnels.julin.dev/)

This project provides a lightweight HTTP tunneling tool similar to ngrok and cloudflaredtunnels, written in C#. It allows you to expose local development servers to the internet for testing and sharing purposes.

This project is designed more for demonstration purposes than for practical application.

Check out the [frontend](https://github.com/q1aa/CSGrock-Frontend) in order to use it!

## Installation

I recommend to download [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and open the whole project in it.

The project requires [dotnet 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) to run, please make sure you have it installed!

`git clone https://github.com/q1aa/CSGrock-Backend.git`

If you have installed VisualStudio just open the .sln file with it.
You can start it now (F5 key as shortcut) and it will listen for socket connections from the [CSGrok frontend](https://github.com/q1aa/CSGrock-Frontend) on port 7006 (https).
